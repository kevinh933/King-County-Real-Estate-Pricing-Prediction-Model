# King County Real Estate Pricing Prediction Model
This project showcases a **Multiple Linear Regression Model** to predict **real estate prices** in King County, WA, supporting data-driven real estate decisions. This model uses real housing data provided to the public from 2014 to 2015. We compared the predicted prices with the actual prices and found it to have 73% accuracy. 

## Key Components
Cleaned and prepared real estate data using **Excel**  
Built regression model in **RStudio** to predict property prices  
Analyzed key pricing factors through statistical analysis  
Presented insights and model performance in PowerPoint  

## Diagrams Used
Density plots/histograms, 

Correlation plot (for multicollinearity),  

Scatter plots (for linearity), 

Box plots (relationship with categorical variables), 

Residuals vs Fitted plot (Linearity and Independence), 

Q-Q plot (for normality), 

Residual vs Fitted and scale location plot (for homoscedasticity),  

## Multiple Linear Regression Model
Independent and response variables are identified with x (house price) and y variables (square feet, bedrooms, etc.)

Use MLR equation for price prediction
